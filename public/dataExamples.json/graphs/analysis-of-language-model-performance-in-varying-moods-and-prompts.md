## Introduction

In recent years, the utility of language models has become increasingly pivotal across various technological and communicative domains. As these models become integral to digital interactions, it is crucial to comprehend the nuanced factors that affect their outputs. This study investigates the influence of mood settings on the performance of different language models, with a specific focus on their linguistic output and emoji usage. Such an understanding not only enhances model interpretability and user experience but also aids developers in tailoring these models to specific applications.

This research is anchored in a factorial ANOVA experiment, designed to scrutinize how predefined mood levels impact language models' responses. The experimental setup capitalizes on a full factorial design, permitting a thorough exploration of main effects and interaction effects between factors — principally the mood settings and the language models themselves. The study incorporates a variety of prompt noise variables to simulate diverse conversational contexts. Each trial assesses a collection of response variables including word count, emoji rate, emoji count, sentence count, and others, thereby offering a comprehensive profile of language model behavior under different conditions.

The models evaluated in this study include prominent iterations from leading AI developers, specifically gpt-4o-mini from OpenAI, gemini-2.0-flash from Google, gemma2-9b-it from Groq, and claude-3-haiku-20240307 from Anthropic. Each model was subjected to three distinct mood settings, namely "Happy," "Sad," and "Empty," to determine how these emotional contexts alter language generation and emoji incorporation.

Statistical analyses, primarily facilitated through ANOVA, reveal that model choice significantly influences several response variables such as word count, sentence count, character count, and unique word count, with large effect sizes evident in these metrics. Contrarily, the impact of mood on the same variables was found to be statistically insignificant with notably low effect sizes. Furthermore, no meaningful interaction effects were observed between mood and model on the examined variables.

The motivation behind this inquiry stems from a desire to elucidate the impact of ambient mood on language model outputs, especially in regard to emoji use, which is increasingly prevalent in digital communications. Such insights are particularly relevant for a technical audience that values detailed statistical evaluations and their implications on language model optimization.

In summation, this investigation contributes valuable insights into the modulation of language model outputs by emotional context, serving as a foundational step towards optimizing these models for more empathetic and context-aware applications.

## Background

Language models, a subset of artificial intelligence, have advanced significantly in recent years, contributing to notable improvements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models, such as those developed by OpenAI, Google, Groq, and Anthropic, are designed to generate human-like text based on the input they receive. Language models like GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have showcased remarkable capabilities in various applications, from content creation to real-time language translation, indicating the broad potential of these technologies (Brown et al., 2020).

### Context

In the realm of artificial intelligence research, understanding the nuances of language model outputs, including factors like response length, emoji usage, and sentence structure, is critical for optimizing their deployment in diverse applications. Emphasis has been placed on the model's ability to adapt to different contextual cues and emotional undertones embedded within the input, a concept referred to as "mood settings." Mood settings can play a pivotal role in tailoring responses to suit user needs more closely.

The integration of mood settings into language models involves instilling specific emotional contexts into the stimuli provided to these models. Research has demonstrated that mood settings can significantly affect human cognition and communication (Forgas, 1995), ultimately influencing how information is processed and conveyed. In the context of language models, mood can potentially alter generative output in terms of style, tone, and emotional depth, allowing for a more nuanced interaction with end-users.

### Previous Research

Prior studies have explored the influence of contextual and emotional cues on text generation. For instance, emotional priming has been shown to modify the semantic output of language models, making them more versatile and adaptable to the task requirements (Boucher & Osgood, 1969). Furthermore, research by Zhong et al. (2018) investigated mood influences on human-computer interaction, revealing that emotionally intelligent systems can enhance user satisfaction and engagement.

The integration of such mood variables into machine learning models could magnify the impact of language models in human-centered applications, leading to more effective and empathetic communication systems.

### Importance of Mood Settings

In the current experiment, the effects of varying mood settings—categorized as Happy, Sad, and Empty—on different language models were systematically examined. The study aimed to quantify the extent to which these settings impact the linguistic outputs of models, specifically focusing on variables such as word count and emoji usage. Understanding how different mood settings affect language models is crucial for applications requiring emotional intelligence, such as mental health support systems, customer service, and educational tools.

The analysis, employing factorial ANOVA, underscores the significance and potential for further exploration into how implicit mood settings can be optimized to enhance the functionality and user experience of language model-driven systems. As these models become increasingly embedded in daily life, ensuring that they can appropriately interpret and respond to various emotional contexts remains a fundamental research challenge.



<a id="objectives"></a>

## Objectives

The primary objective of the experiment was to investigate the effects of varying mood settings on the output responses generated by different language models. By focusing on how mood influences these outputs, the study aimed to assess whether language models' generated text, specifically word choice, sentence structure, and length, is significantly altered by emotional context. Additionally, the experiment sought to explore the use of emojis in responses and how mood setting can affect this aspect of communication.

To accomplish these objectives, a factorial ANOVA experiment was designed, utilizing a comprehensive set of mood levels—Happy, Sad, and Empty—in a full factorial approach. This design allowed for a thorough examination of both main effects (the independent impact of mood or model type on responses) and interaction effects (how mood and model type jointly influence output variables).

The specific objectives included:

1. **Evaluation of Mood Impacts on Model Responses**: By varying the mood context, the study aimed to analyze whether mood settings significantly alter the attributes of model-generated responses, such as word count, sentence count, and character count.

2. **Assessment of Emoji Usage**: A key focus was to understand how different mood levels affect the frequency and manner of emoji usage within generated responses. This aspect had implications for interpreting how language models might utilize emojis differently based on emotional contexts.

Through statistical methods such as ANOVA, the experiment aimed to draw significant conclusions concerning the impact of mood on various linguistic and paralinguistic features generated by selected language models. These findings are crucial for comprehending how mood-imposed contexts can dictate the stylistic and functional elements of language model outputs.

<a id="statistical-analysis"></a>

## Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis of the experimental data was conducted using a factorial ANOVA, which is a powerful statistical method suited for experiments involving multiple factors and their interactions. This analysis aimed to ascertain the main effects of the independent variables and their interaction effects on multiple dependent variables. Key metrics such as p-values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals were utilized to interpret the results.

### P-values

P-values were calculated to determine the statistical significance of the observed effects. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant effect. Notably, the model had a significant impact on variables such as Word Count (p < 0.001), Sentence Count (p < 0.001), Character Count (p < 0.001), and Unique Word Count (p < 0.001). This indicates that there is a very low probability that these observed effects were due to random chance.

### Effect Sizes

Effect sizes were computed using eta squared (η²), which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is attributable to a factor. An η² value greater than 0.14 is typically considered a large effect. For example, the model demonstrated a high effect size on Word Count (η² = 0.7512), Sentence Count (η² = 0.5827), Character Count (η² = 0.7635), and Unique Word Count (η² = 0.7397). These values indicate that a large portion of the variability in these response variables can be explained by the model used.

### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals were computed to provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a certain level of confidence (typically 95%). This provides a measure of precision or reliability of the estimate. For instance, the confidence interval for the mean Word Count of the gemini-2.0-flash model was calculated to be 721.10 (95% CI: 633.91 to 808.28), suggesting that the true mean lies within this interval with 95% confidence.

In conclusion, the use of ANOVA facilitated a robust examination of the experimental data, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the effects of the different models and mood levels on various textual features. The statistical metrics employed, including p-values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals, provided a comprehensive framework for assessing the significance and magnitude of the effects observed in the experiment.

<a id="unique-word-count"></a>

## Unique Word Count

The analysis of the experimental data revealed that the unique word count was significantly impacted by the language models tested. A factorial ANOVA demonstrated the presence of statistically significant differences among the models, with a significance level of p < 0.001 (F(3, 78) = 75.76), and a large effect size (η² = 0.7397). This indicates that the model explains approximately 74.0% of the variance in the unique word count, underscoring the substantial influence exerted by the choice of model.

The mean unique word counts varied significantly between different models. The gemini-2.0-flash model produced the highest unique word count, with a mean of 329.19. This contrasts sharply with the claude-3-haiku-20240307, which generated the lowest mean unique word count of 147.29. The gpt-4o-mini and gemma2-9b-it models achieved mean unique word counts of 191.86 and 185.29, respectively. 

To further elucidate these differences, Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test was employed, controlling for potential Type I errors in multiple comparisons. Significant pairwise differences were observed as follows:

- **gpt-4o-mini vs. gemini-2.0-flash**: A mean difference of -137.33 (p < 0.001) indicates that gemini-2.0-flash significantly outperformed gpt-4o-mini in terms of unique word generation.
- **gemini-2.0-flash vs. gemma2-9b-it**: A mean difference of 143.90 (p < 0.001) further highlights the distinctive lexical diversity provided by gemini-2.0-flash.
- **gemini-2.0-flash vs. claude-3-haiku-20240307**: A mean difference of 181.90 (p < 0.001) reinforces the finding that gemini-2.0-flash's responses contain a notably higher count of unique words compared to claude-3-haiku-20240307.

No statistically significant main effects of mood on unique word count were detected (p = 0.5997), with an insignificantly small effect size (η² = 0.0125). Likewise, interaction effects between model and mood were not significant (p = 0.8361), suggesting that mood variations did not exacerbate or reduce the model's effect on unique word count.

In conclusion, the choice of language model has a profound impact on the unique word count, with the gemini-2.0-flash model delivering the richest lexical diversity. The statistical robustness of these findings highlights an important consideration for selecting language models where text uniqueness is a priority.



<a id="discussion"></a>

## Discussion

The results of the factorial ANOVA experiment provide substantial insight into the influence of various language models on several response variables, particularly focusing on Word Count, Sentence Count, Character Count, and Unique Word Count. The findings confirm that variations among models significantly affect these metrics, highlighting the intrinsic differences in how these models process and generate language output.

### Interpretation of Results

The impact of the model on Word Count is notably significant, with a strong effect size (η² = 0.7512), demonstrating that the choice of model explains a substantial portion of the variance in Word Count. The analysis reveals that "gemini-2.0-flash" produced the highest Word Count with a mean of 721.10, substantially higher than that of "claude-3-haiku-20240307," which had a mean of 243.90. These differences were statistically significant across the models, as substantiated by Tukey's HSD test.

Similarly, significant effects were observed for Sentence Count and Character Count, where the models again demonstrated distinct performance patterns. The "gemini-2.0-flash" model consistently generated higher Sentence and Character Counts, as compared to its counterparts, particularly outperforming "claude-3-haiku-20240307." These results suggest that models vary significantly in verbosity, which could be attributed to underlying architecture or training datasets specific to each model.

Furthermore, the Unique Word Count was significantly affected by the model choice, with "gemini-2.0-flash" again leading in diversity of vocabulary. This metric is crucial as it reflects the model's ability to generate varied and potentially richer content, an essential trait for understanding its applicability in different language tasks.

### Hypotheses and Implications

The initial hypothesis posited that different language models would exhibit variations in response measures such as Word Count and Emoji Rate, influenced by mood settings. While the model effects on Word Count, Sentence Count, Character Count, and Unique Word Count were significant, contrary to expectations, the mood variable did not significantly influence these measures. This lack of significant mood effect suggests that the models may not be sensitive to contextual emotional cues in text generation, retaining a more consistent output structure across different mood settings.

The non-significant model effects on emoji-related metrics indicate that emoji integration in responses may not differ dramatically across models, potentially implying a uniformity in handling emotive symbology across these neural architectures. However, a medium effect size for Emoji Rate and Emoji Count suggests that further analysis could reveal nuances in how models occasionally employ emojis in contextual responses.

### Implications of Model Differences

The variation in performance across models has practical implications. For applications requiring extensive text generation or detailed content, selecting high-performing models like "gemini-2.0-flash" could lead to better outcomes. Conversely, tasks necessitating concise outputs may benefit from models like "gpt-4o-mini" or "claude-3-haiku-20240307," which generally produce shorter responses.

The lack of significant interaction effects between mood and model on most response variables signals a potential area for optimization in model training, focusing on embedding improved contextual sensitivity. Such enhancements could advance the customization of responses based on desired tone or emotional context, thereby augmenting the models' flexibility in real-world applications.

In conclusion, while model selection significantly impacts text generation metrics, the influence of mood remains negligible within the scope of this study. Future iterations could explore broader mood descriptors and include additional models, which may ascertain further significant interactions or effects. As language models evolve, incorporating emotional intelligence could form a pivotal aspect of their development, enhancing interaction quality and user satisfaction.



<a id="interpretation-of-model-impacts"></a>

## Interpretation of Model Impacts

The comprehensive evaluation of the factorial ANOVA experiment reveals the significant impact of language models on several linguistic response variables. This section deliberates on the practical significance of these model-induced effects, focusing on key metrics such as word count, sentence count, and others, to elucidate the implications for natural language generation applications.

### Word Count

The analysis indicates that the choice of model exerts a statistically significant effect on the word count of generated responses. Notably, the **gemini-2.0-flash** model exhibited a substantially higher mean word count (721.10 words) compared to **claude-3-haiku-20240307** (243.90 words). This pronounced effect, evidenced by a high effect size (η² = 0.7512), suggests that the model selection could be critical in contexts requiring verbose outputs, such as educational content generation or detailed explanations.

The significant differences elucidated by Tukey's HSD test underscore the practical relevance of selecting the appropriate model. For tasks demanding extensive textual elaboration, models like **gemini-2.0-flash** appear more suitable, conversely, for concise communication, **claude-3-haiku-20240307** might be preferable. However, it is important to consider context and purpose when tagging a model with specific word count capabilities.

### Sentence Count

A pronounced effect was also discerned for sentence count, with the model explaining a substantial proportion (58.3%) of the variance. The **gemini-2.0-flash** model again outperformed others in terms of generating more sentences, averaging 56.86, as opposed to the **gpt-4o-mini** model's 31.05 sentences. This finding highlights the model’s potential effectiveness in domains that benefit from segmented information delivery, such as in instructional design or multi-stage storytelling.

### Other Metrics

Though the model demonstrated a significant impact on character count and unique word count with high effect sizes (η² = 0.7635 and η² = 0.7397, respectively), other metrics such as emoji rate and average word length exhibited no significant effects. This suggests that while the choice of model greatly affects the quantity and diversity of text generated, it has limited influence over stylistic elements such as expressiveness through emojis or the complexity of vocabulary.

### Practical Implications

The implications of these findings are multifaceted. For developers and researchers designing language applications, the insights into model impacts on fundamental linguistic metrics allow for fine-tuned model selection according to specific application needs. Additionally, industries relying on language models for content creation can leverage these insights to optimize for either content volume or precision in messaging.

Overall, this analysis underscores the necessity of aligning model capabilities with the intended application requirements to harness the full potential of AI-driven language technology in various domains. The substantial variance explained by model type in significant metrics not only highlights the current capabilities of these models but also points towards potential avenues for further refinement and optimization.

## Implications for Emoji Usage

In the conducted factorial ANOVA experiment, it was observed that the metrics specifically related to emoji usage—such as Emoji Rate and Emoji Count—did not yield significant differences across the tested language models or mood levels. This lack of significance in emoji-related metrics can be attributed to several potential factors which are worthy of consideration.

### Lack of Model Sensitivity to Emoji Variation

One potential reason for the absence of significant findings may lie in the inherent design and operational capabilities of the language models analyzed. These models, being primarily developed for text generation and processing tasks, may not exhibit the necessary sensitivity or inclination towards variations in emoji usage. This assertion is supported by the fact that, despite comprehensive trials across different moods and prompts, neither the main effects of models nor mood on Emoji Rate and Emoji Count were statistically significant (p > 0.05).

### Influence of Prompt Structure and Context

The predetermined structure of the prompts used in this experimental setup may also have impacted the frequency of emoji usage. Emojis are often employed contextually to convey emotions, tone, or humor in casual conversation. However, the scientific or instructional nature of the prompt noise variables used (e.g., explaining quantum computing or discussing leadership principles) may not naturally align with scenarios in which emojis are typically utilized. Consequently, the lack of contextually appropriate cues within these prompts could explain the models' limited use of emojis.

### Emoji Use in Professional and Technical Texts

Moreover, emojis are less conventional in professional or technical communications compared to casual or social interactions. Considering the technical audience for which these prompts were designed, the models' tendency to generate responses devoid of emojis might be a reflection of common language use norms in such professional communications.

### Concluding Remarks

Overall, the limited findings on emoji-related metrics highlight the need for further research to explore how language models could be tailored or trained to incorporate emojis more naturally when relevant. Adapting models to understand and generate contextually appropriate emoji usage may enhance their applicability in diverse communicative scenarios, spanning both informal and formal textual interactions. This endeavor, however, necessitates additional experimental designs tailored to specifically address and invoke emoji usage within varied and suitable contexts.

## Conclusion

The factorial ANOVA experiment elucidated several critical insights regarding the influence of language models and mood settings on various response metrics. Key findings demonstrate that language models significantly affect metrics such as Word Count, Sentence Count, Character Count, and Unique Word Count, while the presence of mood settings exerts negligible influence on these metrics. Importantly, significant effects were noted for model type on Word Count (p < 0.001, η² = 0.7512), Sentence Count (p < 0.001, η² = 0.5827), Character Count (p < 0.001, η² = 0.7635), and Unique Word Count (p < 0.001, η² = 0.7397), indicating a substantive level of variance explained by the model.

The analysis revealed that levels of these response variables varied substantially among the models. Specifically, the gemini-2.0-flash model consistently yielded significantly higher output compared to others, with the gemma2-9b-it and claude-3-haiku-20240307 models producing notably lower counts across these metrics. Pairwise comparisons using Tukey's HSD test confirm significant differences between models across Word Count, Sentence Count, and other response variables.

In contrast, mood settings and their interaction with models exhibited no statistically significant effects on any of the evaluated metrics. This suggests that changes in the linguistic tone or intended emotional content of prompts have limited impact on the outputs produced by these language models.

Given these findings, it is recommended to focus future efforts on exploring additional model configurations and expanding the diversity of prompt contexts. This approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding of potential variables influencing language model outputs. Additionally, investigating richer and domain-specific prompt variations could offer insights into how models might adapt to content variation in practical applications.

These insights provide a robust foundation for further experimental ventures, particularly in optimizing model selection and tuning for specific applications that depend heavily on output characteristics such as word diversity and verbosity. Future research could notably benefit from incorporating larger and more varied datasets to assess the models' adaptability to diverse input conditions, enhancing the generalizability of these results.
